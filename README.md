Luister brings the spirit of classic media players into the Python era, with a sleek interface and all the features you expect:

  Click the 'arrow up' button to open a file dialog. Select your music files (hold Ctrl to select multiple), and hit 'Open'. The playlist window will appear automatically.

- **Intuitive Controls:**  
  Once your playlist is loaded, all controls become active.

- **Now Playing Display:**  
  The left LCD shows the current time; the right displays the song title and duration.

- **Time & Volume Sliders:**  
  Adjust playback position and volume on the fly.

- **Shuffle & Loop:**  
  - Shuffle: Randomizes your playlist order for a fresh experience.
  - Loop: Repeats the playlist when it ends.

- **Direct Song Selection:**  
  Click any song in the playlist to play it instantly.

- **Flexible Windows:**
